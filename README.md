# Bema Integrated Services - Developer Skills Test Submission

## üìò Overview

This project is a comprehensive submission for the **Software Developer Skills Test**. It features a **Next.js** frontend application connected to a **headless WordPress** backend.

The application showcases proficiency in:
- Consuming data via both **GraphQL** and **REST API**
- Handling **internal** and **external** data sources
- Creating **custom WordPress API endpoints**

This README outlines the project structure, setup instructions, and key technical insights discovered during development.

---

## üöÄ Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

- **Headless WordPress Setup**  
  Configured using *Local by Flywheel* to serve as the CMS.

- **GraphQL API Consumption**  
  Utilized `graphql-request` to fetch site settings and blog posts from WPGraphQL.

- **Next.js Development**  
  Demonstrated both server-side (`getStaticProps`) and client-side (`useEffect`) data fetching in functional React components.

- **External REST API Integration**  
  Integrated a 3rd-party exchange rate API with dynamic error handling and API key management.

- **Internal REST API Consumption**  
  Built a custom form component interacting with WordPress REST endpoints.

- **Custom WordPress Endpoint**  
  Created a REST endpoint via `register_rest_route` to handle `POST` and `GET` requests.

- **Problem-Solving & Adaptability**  
  Debugged and resolved issues related to deprecated/non-functional endpoints, showcasing resilience and adaptability.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React  
- **Backend**: WordPress (Headless CMS)  
- **APIs**: WPGraphQL, REST API  
- **Environment**: Local by Flywheel  
- **Styling**: CSS Modules (`globals.css`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend (WordPress)

- Set up a local WordPress site using **Local by Flywheel** (e.g., `wp-headless-test`)
- Install and activate:
  - `WPGraphQL`
  - `Easy Digital Downloads`
- Go to **Settings > Permalinks** and select **"Post name"** to ensure proper REST API functionality.
- Add the following snippets to your active theme‚Äôs `functions.php`:

**Custom REST Endpoint for Name Form**
```php
// Add your custom REST logic here

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend (Next.js)
Clone/download this repo and open the wp-next-test folder
Install dependencies:
npm install

Create a .env.local file in the root and add:
# Your local WordPress site URL
WORDPRESS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://wp-headless-test.local/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL=http://wp-headless-test.local/wp-json

# API key from exchangerate-api.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the App
Start the development server:
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Run the standalone exchange rate script:
node exchange-rate.js
Note: Ensure you set the API_ACCESS_KEY inside exchange-rate.js.

üß™ Technical Notes & Findings
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è External Exchange Rate API
Issue: https://api.exchangerate.host/... was non-functional and returned 404.

Action: Switched to https://www.exchangerate-api.com with a free API key.

Outcome: Feature works and showcases adaptability to real-world API shifts.

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Internal EDD REST API Endpoint (/edd/v1/settings)
Issue: The endpoint /wp-json/edd/v1/settings was not available.

Investigation:

Possible deprecation or plugin version change

Conditional route registration (e.g., only after setup wizard)

Outcome: The feature could not be implemented. The logic remains in the codebase for review. The API index at /wp-json/ can be shown during evaluation to confirm its absence.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project not only fulfills the technical requirements but also highlights the ability to adapt to unforeseen issues, debug effectively, and implement real-world solutions.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any questions or review requests.


Paste this directly into your project as `README.md`. Let me know if you also need a sample project folder structure or want the PHP snippets for the WordPress side.
